Therefore, they are required to ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in this Data Protection Policy EU, for data protection are met (e. g. national reporting duties). Within their area of responsibility, management staff is responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR and technical measures are in place so that any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection requirements. Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the relevant employees. If public authorities perform data protection checks, the Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection must be informed immediately.   \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that it has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group Company to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).\\n\\nAll duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

Therefore, members are required to ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in this Data Protection Policy EU, for data protection are met (e. g. national reporting duties). Within duties area of responsibility, management staff is responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR and technical measures are in place so that any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection requirements. Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the relevant employees. If public authorities perform data protection checks, the Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection must be informed immediately.  \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that recipient has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.Transfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group AG to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).All duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.  \n",

       "4  Personal data of the prospective customer, customer, or partner can be processed to establish, perform and terminate a contract. This also includes advisory services for the customer or partner under the contract if this is related to the contractual purpose. Prior to a contract, personal data can be processed to prepare bids or purchase orders or to fulfill other requests of the prospective customer relating to contract conclusion. Prospective customers can be contacted during the contract preparation process using the information that customers have provided. Any restrictions requested by the prospective customers must be complied with. If the data subject contacts a Group Company with a request for information (e. g. request to receive information material about a product), processing of personal data to meet this request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3). If the data subject objects to the use of Customer /subject data for advertising purposes, it can no longer be used for these purposes and must be restricted or blocked from use for these purposes . Any other restrictions from specific countries regarding the use of data for advertising purposes must be observed....  "

Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3).

Therefore, they are required to ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in this Data Protection Policy EU, for data protection are met (e. g. national reporting duties). Within their area of responsibility, management staff is responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR and technical measures are in place so that any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection requirements. Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the relevant employees.

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that it has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group Company to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).\\n\\nAll duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that recipient has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.Transfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group AG to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).All duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

If the data subject contacts a Group Company with a request for information (e. g. request to receive information material about a product), processing of personal data to meet this request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3).

Prospective customers can be contacted during the contract preparation process using the information that customers have provided. Any restrictions requested by the prospective customers must be complied with. If the data subject contacts a controller with a request for information (e. g. request to receive information material about a product), processing of personal data to meet this request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3).

Therefore, they are required to ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in this Data Protection Policy EU, for data protection are met (e. g. national reporting duties). Within their area of responsibility, management staff is responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR and technical measures are in place so that any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection requirements. Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the relevant employees. If public authorities perform data protection checks, the Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection must be informed immediately.   \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that it has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group Company to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).\\n\\nAll duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

Therefore, members are required to ensure that the legal requirements, and those contained in this Data Protection Policy EU, for data protection are met (e. g. national reporting duties). Within duties area of responsibility, management staff is responsible for ensuring that organizational, HR and technical measures are in place so that any data processing is carried out in accordance with data protection requirements. Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the relevant employees. If public authorities perform data protection checks, the data protection officer must be informed immediately.  \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the controller in a third country if the recipient can prove that recipient has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.Transfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, controller will work with the responsible Group AG to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).All duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.  \n",

       "4  Personal data of the prospective customer, customer, or partner can be processed to establish, perform and terminate a contract. This also includes advisory services for the customer or partner under the contract if this is related to the contractual purpose. Prior to a contract, personal data can be processed to prepare bids or purchase orders or to fulfill other requests of the prospective customer relating to contract conclusion. Prospective customers can be contacted during the contract preparation process using the information that customers have provided. Any restrictions requested by the prospective customers must be complied with. If the data subject contacts a controller with a request for information (e. g. request to receive information material about a product), processing of personal data to meet this request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3). If the data subject objects to the use of Customer /subject data for advertising purposes, it can no longer be used for these purposes and must be restricted or blocked from use for these purposes . Any other restrictions from specific countries regarding the use of data for advertising purposes must be observed. Pe...  "

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the Group Companies in a third country if the recipient can prove that it has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, Daimler AG will work with the responsible Group Company to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).\\n\\nAll duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

The data recipient must be required to use the data only for defined purposes. In the event of a cross-border transmission of personal data (including granting access from another country), the relevant national requirements for the transfer of personal data abroad must be fulfilled. In particular, personal data from the EU/ EEA may only be processed outside the controller in a third country if the recipient can prove that recipient has a data protection level equivalent to this Policy. Suitable tools can be: Agreement on EU standard contractual clauses, Participation of the recipient in an EU-accredited certification system for ensuring an adequate level of data protection, or Recognition of binding corporate rules of the recipient to create an adequate level of data protection by the responsible supervisory authorities.Transfers of personal data to any public authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a manner that would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society. In the event of conflicts between these and public authority requirements, controller will work with the responsible Group AG to find a practical solution that fulfills the purpose of this Policy (Section 14.3).All duties listed in this Section 5 are third party beneficiary rights for the data subject.   \n",

       "4  Personal data of the prospective customer, customer, or partner can be processed to establish, perform and terminate a contract. This also includes advisory services for the customer or partner under the contract if this is related to the contractual purpose. Prior to a contract, personal data can be processed to prepare bids or purchase orders or to fulfill other requests of the prospective customer relating to contract conclusion. Prospective customers can be contacted during the contract preparation process using the information that customers have provided. Any restrictions requested by the prospective customers must be complied with. If the data subject contacts a controller with a request for information (e. g. request to receive information material about a product), processing of personal data to meet this request is permitted. Customer loyalty or advertising measures are subject to further legal requirements. Personal data can be processed for advertising purposes or market and opinion research, provided that this is consistent with the purpose for which the data was originally collected. The data subject must be informed in advance about the use of Customer /subject personal data for advertising purposes. If personal data is collected only for advertising purposes, the data subject can choose whether to provide this data. The data subject shall be informed that providing data for this purpose is voluntary. As part of the communication process, consent should be obtained from the data subject. When giving consent, the data subject should be given a choice among available forms of contact, such as e-mail and phone (consent see Section 5.2.3). If the data subject objects to the use of Customer /subject data for advertising purposes, it can no longer be used for these purposes and must be restricted or blocked from use for these purposes . Any other restrictions from specific countries regarding the use of data for advertising purposes must be observed. Pe...   \n",
